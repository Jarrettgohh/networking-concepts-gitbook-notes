# Introduction

_Hello readers!_

This Gitbook document summarizes my findings and learnings on computer networking concepts, based on my knowledge and research. While I strive for accuracy, some notes may be incomplete or incorrect. I'm continuously updating and refining the content as I learn and gain new insights.

If you notice any mistakes or have suggestions for improvement, feel free to contact me at [jarrettgxz.sec@gmail.com](mailto:jarrettgxz.sec@gmail.com). Your feedback is greatly appreciated, thank you!

#### Note on shell prompt convention <a href="#shell-prompt-convention" id="shell-prompt-convention"></a>

The `$` symbol will be used to indicate a shell prompt (defaulting to _Bash_). Some commands may require _root_ privileges via the `sudo` command. However, this documentation will not explicitly specify when `sudo` is required â€” it should be prepended where necessary.
